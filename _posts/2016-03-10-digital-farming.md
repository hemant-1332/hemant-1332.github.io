This project was done as part of GE Edison Challenge which is an open innovation challenge for the university student community in India, organized by the GE India Technology Centre (GEITC).

The objective of challenge was to provide a digital-physical solution for India leveraging Internet of Things in sector like energy, healthcare, transportation and water.

We proposed our Digital Farming solution which was selected in top 25 all over the India and we were called to  GE India Technology Centre to present the working prototype of same.

# Solution Description

To solve the wastage of water in irrigation and loss of fertility of soil, we designed an intelligent irrigation system based on wireless sensor network and fuzzy logic control. Whole system architecture consists of Wireless Transmission Network (WSN) and base station.

WSN consists of number of sensor nodes interfaced with MCU and communication module.

# Irrigation Control Logic

The control logic was based on fuzzy logic which is suitable for the lag, nonlinear and time-varying system, so it is suitable for using fuzzy control strategy to realize the controlling of the monitoring system.
